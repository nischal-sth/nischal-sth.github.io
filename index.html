    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>hello everyone! my name is nischal shrestha . i am an international student from nepal . 
        i dont really know what i want to do in my life yet but lets keep going forword and see what the world has to offer 
        but one of my goal/bucket list in life is to do most of the extreme sports like 
        bungee jumping from the highest place , skydiving , paragliding , rafting ,
        tracking to places like ABC (annapurna base camp) and EBC (everest base camp) with my friends.
     my hobby is fish keeping i really love fish as a pet not as a food and back in nepal i had build 2 of the aquariums by my self at home .
     i really love to travel with my friends and i really enjoy nature like mountains and rivers so that was also one of the reason i chose weber state university .
    i hope we all will be able to be good friends and help each other out in the time of need . </p>
